### -- Pairing Codes
### How should pairing codes be generated? This section pretty much determines that.
### Example:  goose-like-gold

# How many words should a pairing code have. Lower is better for memorising but higher
# reduces collisions. Balance this with the amount of available words for the best result.
pairing-code-blocks: 3

# How many times should the server try to generate a code, in the case that there are
# conflicts, before giving up.
paring-code-generation-attempts: 3
